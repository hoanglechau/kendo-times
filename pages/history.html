        <h2 class="history__title">The Birth of the Nihonto</h2>
        <p class="history__text">
          There are several fundamental points that cannot be
          overlooked in the history of kendo. The first is the advent
          of the “nihonto”, or the Japanese sword.
        </p>
        <p class="history__text">
          The Japanese sword emerged in the middle of the Heian period
          (794-1185), and had a slightly curved blade (sori) with
          raised ridges along its length called “shinogi”. The
          prototypes of this style of sword were used by tribes of
          horsemen in northern Japan during the 9th century. Since
          then, this style of sword was adopted by samurai, and
          forging technology advanced rapidly during the early period
          of warrior hegemony from around the end of the Kamakura
          period (1185–1333). The shape of the blade was distinctive
          with its elevated sides (shinogi). In modern Japanese, the
          term “shinogi-wo-kezuru” means “grinding the shinogi
          together”—in other words, “a tight contest”. Such is the
          influence of the ideals of the sword in Japanese culture.
        </p>

        <h2 class="history__title">
          The Muromachi Shogunate (1392–1573)
        </h2>
        <p class="history__text">
          After the Onin War (1467–77), Japan experienced political
          and social chaos for over a century. It was during this
          epoch that many schools of swordsmanship (kenjutsu) arose.
          In 1543, firearms were introduced into the island of
          Tanegashima off the southern tip of Japan. The Japanese
          sword was forged using the tatarafuki casting method using
          high quality iron sand. However, it did not take long before
          this technology was applied to the production of firearms.
          As a result, the heavily-armored fighting style that
          prevailed hitherto changed dramatically to a lighter
          hand-to-hand style of combat. This in turn resulted in the
          further development and specialization of sword forging
          technology, as well as the establishment of more refined
          techniques and skills of swordsmanship which have been
          handed down to the present day through various schools such
          as the Shinkage-ryu and Itto-ryu.
        </p>

        <h2 class="history__title">The Edo Shogunate 1603–1867)</h2>
        <p class="history__text">
          Japan experienced a peaceful period with the onset of the
          Edo period (1603-1867). During this time, swordsmanship
          evolved from killing techniques to those that sought to
          nurture humanity through concepts such as “katsunin-ken”
          (the life-giving sword). Swordsmanship developed theories
          for victory, and also guided practitioners in leading a
          disciplined way of life. These ideas were compiled in books
          elaborating on the art of warfare and spirituality, such as
          Heiho Kadensho by Yagyu Munenori; Fudochi Shinmyoroku by the
          monk Takuan Soho for Tokugawa Iemitsu, the third Shogun of
          the Tokugawa Government; and Gorin-no-sho (The Book of Five
          Rings) by Miyamoto Musashi. Many other books on theories of
          swordsmanship were published during the middle and latter
          half of the Edo period and these are classics that influence
          kendo today.
        </p>
        <p class="history__text">
          What these works conveyed to the samurai was how overcome
          questions of life and death and how to apply swordsmanship
          in the course of daily life. Samurai studied these works to
          cultivate their minds in their devotion to refining their
          skills in bujutsu. The study of swordsmanship focused the
          samurai’s mind on differentiating between good and evil, and
          accepting their calling to make the ultimate sacrifice in
          times of emergency to fulfill their duty to their clan and
          lord. In peace they worked as civil servants, and in times
          of turmoil they were prepared to fight for justice. This is
          the summation of what is called the “bushido spirit” and
          even after the collapse of the feudal system, this spirit is
          still an important part of the make-up of the Japanese
          people.
        </p>
        <p class="history__text">
          The kenjutsu of the peaceful Tokugawa period was
          characterized by the development of graceful techniques
          deriving from actual combat. There were many masters of the
          sword who were instrumental in the evolution of what was to
          become the kendo that we study today. For example, Naganuma
          Shirozaemon Kunisato of the Jikishin Kage-ryu school
          developed kendo-gu (protective armor) and established a
          training method using the shinai (bamboo-sword) in the early
          1700s. Nakanishi Chuzo Kotake of the Itto-ryu started a new
          training method using a men (head protector) and kendo-gu
          made of bamboo in the mid-1700s which quickly became
          prevalent. Inter-school competitions became popular in the
          latter 1700s. Swordsmen traveled throughout the country in
          search of stronger opponents to improve their skills.
        </p>
        <p class="history__text">
          In the beginning of the 19th century, new types of equipment
          were produced such as the yotsuwari shinai (bamboo swords
          made with four slats). This new shinai was more malleable
          and durable than the previous fukuro shinai (literally,
          bag-covered bamboo sword). Also, a do (torso protector)
          reinforced by leather and coated with lacquer was
          introduced. During this time, the “Three Great Dojo of Edo”
          gained immense popularity in the newly forming style of
          full-contact fencing with bamboo swords and protective
          armor: The Genbukan led by Chiba Shusaku; Renpeikan led by
          Saito Yakuro; and Shigakkan led by Momoi Shunzo. Chiba
          systematized the waza (techniques) of shinai training in the
          “Sixty-Eight Techniques of Kenjutsu” which were classified
          in accordance with striking points. Many of his technical
          innovations are still are still used in kendo today.

        <h2 class="history__title">Meiji Restoration (1868)</h2>
        <p class="history__text">
          After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the samurai class was
          dismantled. The wearing of swords was eventually prohibited
          and the popularity of kenjutsu declined dramatically.
        </p>
        <p class="history__text">
          Although shunned as outdated and useless in the theatre of
          modern warfare, various events during the Satsuma Rebellion
          of 1877—an unsuccessful resistance movement of samurai
          against the newly formed imperial government—led to a
          revival of traditional swordsmanship among government forces
          and the national police agency as means for effective
          physical training. In 1895, the Dai-Nippon Butokukai was
          established as a national umbrella organization to promote
          traditional martial arts in the modern era. This coincided
          with the publication of Nitobe Inazo’s world famous treatise
          in English, Bushido: The Soul of Japan, which addressed the
          culture and philosophy of the samurai.

        <h2 class="history__title">
          First Year of the Taisho Period (1912)
        </h2>
        <p class="history__text">
          In 1912, the “Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kendo Kata” (later renamed
          to Nippon Kendo Kata) was created to unify classical schools
          of swordsmanship and pass on the essence and techniques of
          the Japanese sword to later generations. It was also to
          supplement training with bamboo replicas, and make kendo
          training more realistic. In 1919, Nishikubo Hiromichi
          officially changed the designation of “bujutsu” and
          “kenjutsu” to “budo” and “kendo”. Replacing the suffix of
          “jutsu” (technique or art) with “do” (Way) was meant to
          accentuate the educational and spiritual aspects of kendo,
          rather than the technical or competitive side.
        </p>

        <h2 class="history__title">After Defeat in World War II</h2>
        <p class="history__text">
          After the Second World War, kendo was prohibited for a while
          under the Occupation of the Allied Forces. In 1952, however,
          when the All Japan Kendo Federation was established, kendo
          was formally resurrected. Kendo presently plays an important
          role in school education and is also popular with people of
          all ages and walks of life. Several million kendo
          practitioners enjoy participating in regular sessions of
          keiko (kendo training).
        </p>
        <p class="history__text">
          Furthermore, kendo is gaining interest all around the world.
          The International Kendo Federation (FIK) was established in
          1970 and the first triennial World Kendo Championships (WKC)
          was held in the Nippon Budokan in the same year. The 17th
          World Kendo Championships were held in Incheon, South Korea,
          in September 2018 with competitors from 56 countries and
          regions participating. The 18th World Kendo Championships is
          scheduled to be held in Villebon-sur-Yvette, France, in May
          2021.
