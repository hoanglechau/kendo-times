          Miyamoto Musashi was a Japanese swordsman, philosopher,
          strategist, writer and rōnin, who became renowned through
          stories of his unique double-bladed swordsmanship and
          undefeated record in his 61 duels (next is 33 by Itō
          Ittōsai). Musashi, as he was often simply known, is
          considered a Kensei, a sword-saint of Japan. He was the
          founder of the Niten Ichi-ryū, or Nito Ichi-ryū, style of
          swordsmanship, and in his final years authored The Book of
          Five Rings (五輪の書, Go Rin No Sho) and Dokkōdō (The Path
          of Aloneness).

          Through the Japanese tradition, kendo is linked with
          Miyamoto Musashi who belongs to the national treasure of
          Japan. The Miyamoto Musashi Budokan located in Ōhara-chō[26]
          built in honor of the samurai regularly hosts all of Japan's
          kendo schools. As a result, at the 60th Okayama National
          Sports Meetings in 2005 held at the Miyamoto Musashi
          Budokan, two official techniques from the Niten School
          founded by Musashi were incorporated into the International
          Kendo Federation by the Japanese Minister of Education.

        <p class="people__text">
          Chiba Shūsaku was the founder of the Hokushin Ittō-ryū Hyōhō
          (北辰一刀流兵法) and one of the last masters who was called
          a Kensei (sword saint).
        </p>
        <p class="people__text">
          After studying several styles of martial arts, Shūsaku
          created his own style in the 1820s, and called his school
          Hokushin Ittō-ryū Hyōhō (北辰一刀流兵法). The name is a
          combination from Hokushin Musō-ryū and the Ittō-ryū lines he
          studied. In some ways the Hokushin Ittō-ryū Hyōhō is a
          simplification of the Ittō-ryū forms, but one that
          concentrates on the essentials. Shūsaku’s teaching methods
          were seen as revolutionary and influenced other styles.[1]
          In the Bakumatsu-period there was a saying, "If someone
          needs 6 years of training to master a ryuha, he will only
          need half the time in the Hokushin Ittō-ryū". The curriculum
          of the school contains mainly Kenjutsu, Battojutsu,
          Naginatajutsu and Jūjutsu.
        </p>
        <p class="people__text">
          He introduced gekiken (撃剣) (full contact duels with bamboo
          swords and training armor) to the curriculum of tradition
          arts in the 1820s. Due to the large number of students of
          the Hokushin Ittō-ryū Hyōhō at the end of the Edo period,
          the use of bamboo swords and armor as a form of practice
          became popular. Modern kendo techniques, such as Suriage-Men
          and Oikomi-Men, were originally Hokushin Ittō-ryū
          techniques, were named by Chiba Shūsaku.

        <p class="people__text">
          Sakakibara was a Japanese samurai and martial artist. He was
          the fourteenth headmaster of the Jikishinkage school of
          sword fighting. Through his Jikishinkage contacts he rose to
          a position of some political influence; he taught
          swordsmanship at a government military academy and also
          served in the personal guard of Japan's last two shōguns.
        </p>
        <p class="people__text">
          After the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, Sakakibara was
          instrumental in preserving traditional Japanese sword
          techniques in the early Meiji Era. He popularized public
          gekiken for commercial gain, resulting in increased interest
          in kendo and kenjutsu. Despite his eventual opposition to
          the practice of sword fighting for sport, his work during
          this period laid the foundations for the modern sport of
          kendo. In his later years he taught a number of noted
          martial artists, and was honoured by the All Japan Kendo
          Federation after his death.
