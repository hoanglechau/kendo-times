            A shinai (竹刀) is a Japanese sword typically made of
            bamboo used for practice and competition in kendo. Shinai
            are also used in other martial arts, but may be styled
            differently from kendo shinai, and represented with
            different characters. The light, soft wood used in a
            shinai distinguishes it from other wooden swords such as a
            bokken, which is generally made of heavier, sturdier wood.

            A bokutō (木刀) is a Japanese wooden sword used for
            training in kenjutsu. It is usually the size and shape of
            a katana, but is sometimes shaped like other swords, such
            as the wakizashi and tantō. Some ornamental bokutō are
            decorated with mother-of-pearl work and elaborate
            carvings. Bokutō are traditionally composed of red oak or
            white oak, although any hardwood can be used. In
            comparison, practice swords made of flexible, soft wood
            such as bamboo are referred to as shinai.

          <p class="gear__text">
            The men protects the face, neck, and shoulders. It
            consists of a facemask with several horizontal metal bars
            running the entire width of the face, from the chin to the
            top of the head. To this is attached a long rectangular
            thick cloth padding that curves over the top of the head
            and extends to cover the shoulders. A throat protector is
            attached to the bottom of the facemask. The men is held in
            place with a pair of woven cords that wrap around the head
            and are tied at the back. The back of the men is left open
            for ventilation and the back of the head is unprotected.
            The target areas of the men are the centre top, and upper
            left and right sides for cutting strikes and the centre of
            the throat protector for a thrust.

          <img class="gear__image" src="../images/do.jpg" alt="Dō" />
          <p class="gear__text">
            The main component of the dō is the gently-curving stomach
            and chest protector. The modern form has a pronounced
            bulge to help direct the force of strikes away from the
            soft areas in the middle of the torso. Lacquered bamboo is
            traditionally used although lacquered paper 'fibre'
            (frequently misidentified as fiberglass) or moulded
            plastic are used for less expensive dō. The dō is
            supported from the shoulders by two diagonal ties and is
            restrained at the small of the back with another set of
            ties. The target areas of the dō are the two lower sides
            for a slashing cut to the stomach. The top half of the dō
            is a valid target for a thrust in naginata. In the past,
            this was also a valid target for a thrust in Kendo.

          <p class="gear__text">
            The tare is a thick cloth belt that wraps around the waist
            and ties under the front flap in front of the groin.
            Sturdy cloth covered flaps hang from the belt to protect
            the upper legs and groin. The flaps run along half of the
            belt's length, which should be positioned over the front
            half of the body. The centre flap is usually covered with
            a name tag—zekken (ゼッケン) or nafuda (名札)—that
            identifies the name of the wearer and the dōjō or country
            they represent. There is no target point on tare, it is
            for protection against off-target and accidental strikes.

          <p class="gear__text">
            The kote are mitten-like gloves. They were designed
            expressly for kendo. While appearing to be cumbersome,
            enough mobility is allowed to grip the shinai in a
            comfortable, powerful, and firm way. Kote for
            naginatajutsu practitioners have a singulated index finger
            and thumb to better facilitate the rapid shifting of the
            hands along the length of the naginata's shaft. Naginata
            kote have a little less padding than those used for kendo.
            In the past, kote were often made with fully articulated
            fingers. This is rarely seen today as there can be a
            safety issue with snagged fingers. A special heavily
            padded design known as oni-gote (鬼小手) are used by some
            koryu, most notably Itto-ryu. The target area is the wrist
            portion of each kote.
