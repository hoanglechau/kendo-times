      <h2 class="title">2/ Introduction:</h2>
      <p class="text">
        My website is a magazine and newsletter for the "Kendo"
        Japanese martial art. It is called "Kendo Times". It has five
        pages: Home, History, People, Gear, and Dojos. All five pages
        have the same header and footer. The header contains the
        magazine logo and a navigation section with the links to the
        five pages of the website. The are hover effects when the
        users hover their mouses over the logo and the navigation
        links, which show that they are clickable. When the users
        click on the logo, they will be taken to the Home page. The
        footer is simple and contains the information about the
        creator of the website.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        On the Home page, there is an image carousel and the users can
        use the arrows to swipe the images horizontally. There are six
        images of Kendo events. The image carousel is created using
        the "Swiper" JavaScript Library. Right below this image
        carousel is the news section which contains five news
        articles. Each article has an image and a short text. If the
        users want to read more, they can click on the news articles
        to access the original links. There is a hover effect when the
        users hover their mouses over these news articles to show that
        they are clickable. The next section below is the newsletter
        subscription area, which contains a button that the users can
        click on to open the subscription modal. This modal was
        created by me using JavaScript. The button has a hover effect
        and a click effect to show that it's clickable and has been
        clicked. When the subscription modal is opened, the
        "Subscribe" button will be initially disabled, and it will
        only be enabled when the users have entered acceptable input
        into the two input fields. The form has a validation
        functionality for the two inputs which was also written by me
        in JavaScript. The users can close the modal by clicking on
        the "X" button, or by clicking outside of the modal, or by
        hitting the "Escape" key on their keyboards. After the users
        have input their name and email address and click on the
        "Subscribe" button, another modal will be opened, confirming
        that the users have been subscribed to the newsletter. This
        modal was created using the "SweetAlert2" JavaScript library.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        On the History page, there is a big heading below the header.
        Under this heading is the section with the contents about the
        history of Kendo. The "fullPage" JavaScript library was used
        to create the fullscreen scrolling functionality of the
        contents of this page. Each section of the contents is shown
        as a full page one by one as the users scroll their mouses.
        Each section contains a big title and texts below it.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The People page has quite a similar design to the History
        page. It also has the fullscreen scrolling functionality
        created with the "fullPage" JavaScript library. The difference
        is that in the contents section, there are images of the
        mentioned people, and when users click on these images, an
        image preview modal will be opened. This functionality and the
        modal is created by me in JavaScript. The modal contains a
        full preview of the images along with a caption below.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        On the Gear page, there is also a big heading under the
        header. In the contents section, for each gear item, there is
        a title, an image, and a text describing the item. The images
        on this page are also clickable and will also open an image
        preview modal. This functionality is similar to the People
        page. However, instead of having fullscreen scrolling, this
        page has a fade-in animation for each gear item. This
        animation was created using the "AOS (Animate on Scroll)"
        JavaScript library.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        On the Dojos page, there is no fullscreen scrolling or fade-in
        animation, but for each dojo (the room or hall that Kendo is
        practiced in), there is an interactive map showing the
        location of the dojo in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The maps
        were created using the "Leaflet" JavaScript library. Each map
        has a pin on the exact location of the dojo, and a popup
        containing the name and address of the dojo. The users can
        zoom in and zoom out of the map using the "+" and "-" buttons
        on the top left.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        All five pages of the website have responsive designs for
        desktop and mobile users (tablets and mobile phones).
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">3/ Inspiration:</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The first thing that inspired me is my love for Japanese
        culture and history. Kendo is one of the most famous Japanese
        martial arts, so I would like to learn more about it and
        practice it one day.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The second thing is the website of the popular basketball
        magazine "SLAM". I think it has a simple yet elegant design,
        so I used it as an inspiration for the design of my website.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The third thing is the low number of online Kendo magazines
        while there are several online magazines for basketball, my
        favorite sport. Therefore, I wanted to make an online magazine
        website for Kendo.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">4/ Accessibility:</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Firstly, I used correct headings to organize the structure of
        my pages. This makes my website well-organized and can be
        easily interpreted by screen readers.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Secondly, I used proper alt texts to describe the images on my
        website. This helps screen reader users to understand the
        messages conveyed by these images.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Thirdly, my links and buttons have unique and descriptive
        names, which makes it easy for users to navigate around and
        use my website.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Additionally, the newsletter subscription form on the Home
        page is designed for accessibility. Each field has a
        descriptive label. I used the "label" tags and ARIA properties
        to associate the label texts with the form fields.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">5/ Usability:</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Firstly, I designed the interface of my website to be simple
        and easy for users to navigate around the use it. The
        information is clear and very straightforward to use.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Secondly, I chose only relevant information to the target
        users of my website, which are people who are interested in
        Kendo in Ho Chi Minh City. On my website, they can learn more
        about Kendo, and find places to study Kendo.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Thirdly, the users do not require instructions in order to be
        able to use my website. I designed my website in a way that
        feels familiar to the users, which allows them to be able to
        use my website easily based on their existing experience and
        not have to run into any difficulties.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">6/ Learning:</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The first thing that I had to learn to create my website was
        how to use JavaScript libraries. I figured this out by finding
        the most popular libraries, choosing the ones that are useful
        for my design ideas, then reading the documentation of these
        libraries to find out how to use them.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The second thing was how to create the subscription modal with
        form validation on the Home page. I followed some online
        tutorials and YouTube videos to learn how to do each of these,
        then use that knowledge to create my own modal and form
        validation.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The third thing was how to create the image-preview modal that
        opens when users click on the images. I also used online
        tutorials and YouTube videos to figure out how to do this, and
        applied that knowledge to create my own modal.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">7/ Evaluation I:</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The first thing that I think was successful is the nice design
        of the website. I think it looks simple yet elegant, just the
        way I wanted it to be. I also used black, white, and red
        colors, my three favorite colors for this website, which makes
        me like it even more.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The second thing is the functionalities of the website. I
        think the modals work great and the form validation also works
        correctly. The animations and the maps created by the
        JavaScript libraries made the website much more interesting to
        use.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The third thing is the usefulness of my website. I really
        enjoy using it to learn more about Kendo and the process of
        making it has taught me a lot about Kendo, and also inspired
        me to take on real Kendo practice myself.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">8/ Evaluation II:</h2>
      <p class="text">
        I think the design of the pages can be improved to make them
        look even better. Next time, I may use more CSS animations or
        use other JavaScript libraries to create more interesting
        animations and interactivity on my website.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Another thing that I want to do next time is to include a page
        where users can find places to buy Kendo gear.
      </p>
