                    Miyamoto Musashi was a Japanese swordsman,
                    philosopher, strategist, writer and rōnin, who
                    became renowned through stories of his unique
                    double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record
                    in his 61 duels (next is 33 by Itō Ittōsai).
                    Musashi, as he was often simply known, is
                    considered a Kensei, a sword-saint of Japan. He
                    was the founder of the Niten Ichi-ryū, or Nito
                    Ichi-ryū, style of swordsmanship, and in his final
                    years authored The Book of Five Rings (五輪の書,
                    Go Rin No Sho) and Dokkōdō (The Path of
                    Aloneness).

                    Through the Japanese tradition, kendo is linked
                    with Miyamoto Musashi who belongs to the national
                    treasure of Japan. The Miyamoto Musashi Budokan
                    located in Ōhara-chō[26] built in honor of the
                    samurai regularly hosts all of Japan's kendo
                    schools. As a result, at the 60th Okayama National
                    Sports Meetings in 2005 held at the Miyamoto
                    Musashi Budokan, two official techniques from the
                    Niten School founded by Musashi were incorporated
                    into the International Kendo Federation by the
                    Japanese Minister of Education.

                    and called his school Hokushin Ittō-ryū Hyōhō
                    (北辰一刀流兵法). The curriculum of the school

                    Sakakibara was a Japanese samurai and martial
                    artist. He was the fourteenth headmaster of the
                    Jikishinkage school of sword fighting. Through his
                    Jikishinkage contacts he rose to a position of
                    some political influence; he taught swordsmanship

                    After the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate,
                    Sakakibara was instrumental in preserving
                    traditional Japanese sword techniques in the early
                    Meiji Era. He popularized public gekiken for
                    commercial gain, resulting in increased interest
                    in kendo and kenjutsu. Despite his eventual
                    opposition to the practice of sword fighting for
                    sport, his work during this period laid the
                    foundations for the modern sport of kendo. In his
                    later years he taught a number of noted martial
                    artists, and was honoured by the All Japan Kendo
                    Federation after his death.
