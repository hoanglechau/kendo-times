        My website is a magazine and newsletter for the "Kendo"
        Japanese martial art. It is called "Kendo Times". It has five
        pages: Home, History, People, Gear, and Dojos. All five pages
        have the same header and footer. The header contains the
        magazine logo and a navigation section with the links to the
        five pages of the website. The are hover effects when the
        users hover their mouses over the logo and the navigation
        links, which show that they are clickable. When the users
        click on the logo, they will be taken to the Home page. The
        footer is simple and contains the information about the
        creator of the website.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        On the Home page, there is an image carousel and the users can
        use the arrows to swipe the images horizontally. There are six
        images of Kendo events. The image carousel is created using
        the "Swiper" JavaScript Library. Right below this image
        carousel is the news section which contains five news
        articles. Each article has an image and a short text. If the
        users want to read more, they can click on the news articles
        to access the original links. There is a hover effect when the
        users hover their mouses over these news articles to show that
        they are clickable. The next section below is the newsletter
        subscription area, which contains a button that the users can
        click on to open the subscription modal. This modal was
        created by me using JavaScript. The button has a hover effect
        and a click effect to show that it's clickable and has been
        clicked. When the subscription modal is opened, the
        "Subscribe" button will be initially disabled, and it will
        only be enabled when the users have entered acceptable input
        into the two input fields. The form has a validation
        functionality for the two inputs which was also written by me
        in JavaScript. The users can close the modal by clicking on
        the "X" button, or by clicking outside of the modal, or by
        hitting the "Escape" key on their keyboards.

        On the History page, there is a big heading below the header.
        Under this heading is the section with the contents about the
        history of Kendo. The "fullPage" JavaScript library was used
        to create the fullscreen scrolling functionality of the
        contents of this page. Each section of the contents is shown
        as a full page one by one as the users scroll their mouses.
        Each section contains a big title and texts below it.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The People page has quite a similar design to the History
        page. It also has the fullscreen scrolling functionality
        created with the "fullPage" JavaScript library. The difference
        is that in the contents section, there are images of the
        mentioned people, and when users click on these images, an
        image preview modal will be opened. This functionality and the
        modal is created by me in JavaScript. The modal contains a
        full preview of the images along with a caption below.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        On the Gear page, there is also a big heading under the
        header. In the contents section, for each gear item, there is
        a title, an image, and a text describing the item. The images
        on this page are also clickable and will also open an image
        preview modal. This functionality is similar to the People
        page. However, instead of having fullscreen scrolling, this
        page has a fade-in animation for each gear item. This
        animation was created using the "AOS (Animate on Scroll)"
        JavaScript library.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        On the Dojos page, there is no fullscreen scrolling or fade-in
        animation, but for each dojo (the room or hall that Kendo is
        practiced in), there is an interactive map showing the
        location of the dojo in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The maps
        were created using the "Leaflet" JavaScript library. Each map
        has a pin on the exact location of the dojo, and a popup
        containing the name and address of the dojo. The users can
        zoom in and zoom out of the map using the "+" and "-" buttons
        on the top left.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        All five pages of the website have responsive designs for
        desktop and mobile users (tablets and mobile phones).
